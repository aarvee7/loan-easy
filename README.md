I have used Angular as Front End since i havent got oppurtunity to work in React.

Stack Used : 

Front End - Angular
Back End - NodeJs
DB - Postgres
Cloud - Heroku

I have created a loan calculator and captured Geolocation/ip address and stored in DB. (No provision in UI placed for Geolocation and IP).
Please, go through codebase to understand how it is written to capture data.

I hosted the app in heroku and used their hobby postgres DB.

Table Name - "Confidential" which contains Geolocation and IP of the visitor.

Note- i have erased the data since it contains my ip information.

please access the application and verify the DB for data capture. 

Simple loan calculator which will give monthly emi's and total amount payable.( Excuse the UI)

**if some more time available would have included all the requirements.
